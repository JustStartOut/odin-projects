    <h3>Description</h3>
    <h5>Ingredients:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>a good beef fillet</li>
        <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>250g/9oz chestnut mushroom</li>
        <li>50g/2oz butter</li>
        <li>1 large sprig fresh thyme</li>
        <li>100ml/3.5 fl oz dry white wine</li>
        <li>12 slices prosciutto</li>
        <li>500g/1lb 2oz pack puff pastr</li>
        <li>a little flour</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h5>Steps:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to <strong>220C/fan 200C/gas</strong> 7.</li>
        <li>Sit the 1kg beef fillet on a roasting tray, brush with 1 tbsp olive oil and season with pepper, then roast for 15 mins for medium-rare or 20 mins for medium. When the beef is cooked to your liking, remove from the oven to cool, then chill in the fridge for about 20 mins.</li>
        <li>While the beef is cooling, chop 250g chestnut (and wild, if you like) mushrooms as finely as possible so they have the texture of coarse breadcrumbs. </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp of the olive oil and 50g butter in a large pan and fry the mushrooms on a medium heat, with 1 large sprig fresh thyme, for about 10 mins stirring often, until you have a softened mixture.</li>
        <li>Remove the mushroom duxelle from the pan to cool and discard the thyme.</li>
    </ol>
